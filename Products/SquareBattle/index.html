        <h2>About SquareBattle</h2>
        <p>
          SquareBattle is a game written in LabVIEW where you create your own team of squares to compete against
          other peoples teams in an arena. It was created with the following goals:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To be a fun way to learn about LabVIEW and Object Oriented Programming</li>
          <li>To promote community networking and bonding</li>
          <li>To provide a challenging game that allows players to be creative while rewarding well designed code</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id='rules'>Tournament Rules</h2>
        <h3>(subject to change)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Each coder can submit as many SquareBattle teams as they want, within reason.</li>
          <li>The code will be reviewed before being placed into the tournament and we reserve the right to reject any code.</li>
          <li>1vs1 battles will take place in a 150x150 arena. The winner is determined after 2000 rounds or 2 minutes, whichever occurs first.</li>
          <li>Free-for-all battles will take place in a 250x250 arena with 16 teams at a time. The winner is determined after 3000 rounds or 5 minutes, whichever occurs first.</li>
          <li>Winners are determined by the team that has the most squares at the end of battle. The winner is determined semi-randomly in the rare case of a tie.</li>
          <li>The top teams in the 1vs1 battles will go on to compete in the final showdown, and the winner of that will be receiving the grand prize, BOSE QuietComfort 35 wireless noise-cancelling headphones.</li>
        </ol>
