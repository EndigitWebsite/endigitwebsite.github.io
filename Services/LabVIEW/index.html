            Endigit can best help your business by helping with the software development process.
            LabVIEW is an industry standard that is easy to make some progress.
            It has been made to make it easier to acquire data and do processing on that data.
            This is great, but can also lead to problems with less experienced LabVIEW developers.
            Many companies have LV developers with a little bit of experience who can make basic programs.
            This is effective for small projects, but breaks down when projects get complex.
            Large LV applications can be complex and need expert guidance to ensure it is done properly.
            <br>
