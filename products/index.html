        <p>
          SquareBattle is a game written in LabVIEW where you create your own team of squares to compete against
          other peoples teams in an arena. It was created with the following goals:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To be a fun way to learn about LabVIEW and Object Oriented Programming</li>
          <li>To promote community networking and bonding</li>
          <li>To provide a challenging game that allows players to be creative while rewarding well designed code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is highly recommended for a fun way to have a friendly competition at a LabVIEW User Group meeting or
          amongst your peers.

        <h3>FAQs:</h3>
        <p>Why does the text in IP Blaster appear too large and not fit?</p>
        <p>
          If the text in IP Blaster appears too large and doesn't fit, you may have your Windows text size set to a higher
          percentage than normal.  To fix this, follow the instructions <a
