    <h1>Need to talk BACnet in LabVIEW?</h1>
    <p>
      BACnet is the ASHRAE Building Automation and Control networking protocol.  It is a flexible standard used in building
      systems such as heating, air conditioning, light control, fire detection, etc.  The standard itself is object oriented
      and lends itself to a LabVIEW implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Endigit has extensive experience with talking to BACnet devices in LabVIEW.  We have developed a class-based API
      natively in LabVIEW that talks over both BACnet-IP and BACnet MSTP and could easily be extended to other BACnet
      supported interface layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are in need of LabVIEW development involving BACnet, looking for a starting point to talk to BACnet devices in
      LabVIEW or are simply wanting to collaborate on how to get started with BACnet in LabVIEW, please contact us.  We're
      happy to help out at any level of involvement.
