        <h1>Why LabVIEW?</h1>
        <p>
          Endigit's goal is to help its customers be successful.  We choose LabVIEW as a software development platform because
          customer projects can be successfully completed faster with LabVIEW.  We make this claim based on our experience and
          the reasons listed below.  We encourage software development policy to be carefully considered, since a
          <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='http://jshoer.wordpress.com/2007/08/03/why-i-hate-despise-detest-and-loathe-labview/'>mandated use of LabView</a>
          won't make engineers successful.  However, we agree with this
          <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2011/10/12/national-instruments-is-leading-a-quiet-technological-revolution/'>Forbes article</a>:
          <blockquote>
            What LabVIEW has meant for testing is increased productivity – the ability to do more in less time with fewer
            people, while still achieving the same results.
          </blockquote>
          and with Steve McConnell, <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='http://www.cc2e.com'>Code Complete</a>:
          <blockquote>
            Programmers working with high-level languages achieve better productivity and quality than those working with
            lower-level languages.
          </blockquote>

        <h2>Why Endigit uses LabVIEW</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>National Instruments</b>: LabVIEW is sold and distributed by National Instruments (NI).  As a company, NI has
            followed its <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='http://www.ni.com/company/'>vision</a> of empowering engineers by equipping them with tools
            that accelerate productivity.  By using LabVIEW, Endigit partners with a company that is dedicated to empowering
            engineers to do their job.  Examples of NI's vision are:
            <ul>
              <li>LabVIEW improves with each version released.</li>
              <li>
                NI provides excellent <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='http://www.ni.com/support/'>technical support</a>.  Endigit receives prompt
                help when unexpected issues arise.
              </li>
              <li>
                NI contributes <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='http://www.ni.com/white-papers/'>technical content</a> that helps engineers with many
                technologies.  How to use the technology with LabVIEW is usually explained.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li><li>
            <b>Hardware Integration:</b> LabVIEW was designed for the purpose of interfacing with Hardware.  The list below
            summarizes features that allow Endigit to more quickly develop customer solutions:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Single Environment</b>: FPGAs, Real-time targets, and many custom instruments can all be programmed with
                LabVIEW.  This means that a system with multiple computers or computing devices can be programmed from
                one computer with one development environment.  Not having to learn different programming environments and
                switch between applications/computers is a huge benefit to an engineer.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Unlimited Hardware Options</b>: National Instruments' hardware products is vast and continually expanding.
                If NI doesn't have a hardware solution, the Instrument Driver Network (IDNet) has thousands of LabVIEW drivers
                for communicating with 3rd-party devices.  Many hardware manufactures release a LabVIEW driver with their
                products.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li><li>
            <b>Development Environment</b>: LabVIEW has key features that are vital to Endigit's business.  They are listed
            here:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Graphical Source Code (G):</b> The graphical nature of G code has the potential to be messy and hard to read.
                 However, it also has the potential convey information more quickly than a text-based language.  Endigit
                believes easy to read code has less defects, is easier to modify, and is more optimizable.   Endigit develops
                clean block diagrams that save customers' money in debugging, maintenance, and feature changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>User Interface Components:</b> Standard computer user interface elements such as tables, lists, buttons, and
                text fields are available in LabVIEW.  User interface elements familiar in the test and measurement industry,
                such as gauges, knobs, graphs, and LEDs are also available.  LabVIEW's ability to create a user interface that
                is simple and intuitive for the end users is very important to Endigit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b><a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='http://www.ni.com/labview/why/programming-approaches/'>Interoperability</a></b>: LabVIEW can
                integrate with dlls, C code, .Net code, M Scripts, and more.  LabVIEW can easily interface with almost any third
                party technology or tool.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Front Panel Interaction:</b> LabVIEW code is organized into VIs.  Each VI has a front panel that specifies
                the inputs to the LabVIEW code.  This interaction is powerful because it allows low-level LabVIEW code to be
                tested before being run.  Debugging an application is also easier, since the inputs of the code can be captured
                during unexpected behavior, then the code can be debugged using the input data that exposes the problem.
                Engineers can be more efficient since the same user interface components used for the operator interface Front
                Panel are available for use in troubleshooting low level code.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Features for Engineers:</b> Features such as TDMS files (for high speed and large data storage), Microsoft
                Office Reporting toolkit, PID algorithms, FFT Analysis, and hundreds of other engineering features mean Endigit
                spends less time creating customer solutions. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Endigit looks to customer needs and customer preferences while evaluating which tools to use.  We depend on quality
          tools, and LabVIEW has delivered this quality.  While each customer project has different needs, we consistently
          find LabVIEW able to deliver solutions for these needs.
